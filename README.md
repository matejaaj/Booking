# Booking application

## Project Overview

This is a booking application developed by a team of five, designed to facilitate the management of tours,  transportation and accomodation services. 
My primary responsibility was implementing the features related to the Tourist role. I collaborated closely with team members responsible for the Driver and Tour Guide roles to ensure seamless integration across these functionalities. 
The project emphasized clean code principles and the use of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, aligning with the course objectives for which this project was developed.
The user interface was specifically designed for users who are not familiar with similar applications, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
